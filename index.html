    <p>Senior year. Four years ago I didn't think I would make it this far or even like the app academy as much as I do. Signing up, I thought it would be similar to the robotics classes I had become so accustomed to in middle school. However, it wasn't that at all...it wasn't better but it was still pretty fun. My first 3 years were a little difficult going through 4 different teachers with different teaching styles but so far during my senior year I feel like I'm able to really understand what I'm being taught, thank you Ms. Boyles. This is my portfolio where I'm going to show off some of my favorite works from app academy and some other subjects I'm passionate about. Also, if you haven't already figured it out, Morgan State is the college I will be attending in the fall on a full academic scholarship and I am very excited!</p>
