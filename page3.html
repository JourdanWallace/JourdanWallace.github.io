    <p>This is a video Ricardo and I made for our AP Government class about the benefits of medical marijuana concerning certain people, such as those battling mental illness. Ricardo plays a Veteran that suffers from PTSD and he volunteered for an ad that is trying to get it legalized. Here I have the video with acting by the Ricardo J. Harris and wonderful narration by yours truly. Paid for by the Legalize Marijuana Now Party.</p>
