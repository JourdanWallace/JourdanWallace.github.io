    <p>This has to be my favorite app academy game I have had the opportunity to create. Between the cool mini map and the words "app academy" written in lava and water which I thought was extremly cool and creative on my part. The language used in this project was PHP which required us to use a database as well as long into a server in order to create a username and password. The game is pretty simple and rather fun and it is something I'm actually proud to call mine.
